# Rock, Paper, Scissors Simulation

## Description

This project simulates a dynamic environment where rocks, papers, and scissors interact within a 2D space. Utilizing the Raylib library, the simulation showcases basic physics principles as these elements move, collide, and transform into one another.

## Features

- **Dynamic Interaction**: Rocks, papers, and scissors move randomly within the window, bouncing off walls and interacting upon collision.
- **Physics Simulation**: Each element exhibits basic physics behaviors, including velocity and collision detection.
